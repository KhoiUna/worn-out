## Description use case

The time has come to go to another business meeting where you have to give a presentation. You look in the closet and wonder what you wore
to the last meeting. You really need a better way to keep track of when you wore a suit last. You look for applications to solve this dilemma.
This is when you find the Worn-Out App.

This application will let you pull up that photo you posted to the company site of the last meeting and see what you wore, enter that into the app.
You list a date that you last wore it and give it a memorable label.

## Life before the Worn-Out App

You shift clothes aimlessly around your closet not sure of when you wore a suit or outfit last.
This has you questioning your memory. Why can't you just remember? You just have to guess and hope for the best.
Your colleagues stare at you and whisper about how that same suit seems to be the only one you own.

## Life after the Worn-Out App

You show up to functions in new attire. Friends and colleagues are always seeing you in new looks. They ask how you always never
seem to wear the same thing twice. Then you refer them to Worn-Out APP. You explain how you can keep track of all the suits you have worn
to all the functions you're required to attend with ease now.
